# 🌿 AgroScan –  Plant Disease Detection 

**AgroScan** is a deep learning-powered solution that detects crop leaf diseases from images. The model is designed to be deployed via a **WhatsApp chatbot** using Twilio, making it accessible to farmers and agricultural workers in remote or low-connectivity areas.

AgroScan is currently being developed as part of the **Africa Deep Tech Challenge 2025**.
